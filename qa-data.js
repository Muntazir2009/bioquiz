    question: "What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or breaks down?",
    answer:
      "If the plasma membrane ruptures, the contents of the cell leak into the surrounding environment. This disturbs the internal balance of the cell, stops essential life processes, and ultimately leads to cell death."
  },

  {
    question: "What would happen to the life of a cell if there was no Golgi apparatus?",
    answer:
      "Without the Golgi apparatus, proteins and lipids would not be modified or transported properly. This would disrupt secretion and intracellular transport, severely affecting the survival of the cell."
  },

  {
    question: "Which organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell? Why?",
    answer:
      "Mitochondria are called the powerhouse of the cell because they release energy in the form of ATP during cellular respiration. This energy is essential for all life activities of the cell."
  },

  {
    question: "Where do the lipids and proteins constituting the cell membrane get synthesised?",
    answer:
      "Lipids are synthesised in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, while proteins are synthesised by ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These are later processed by the Golgi apparatus."

  {
    question: "How does an Amoeba obtain its food?",
    answer:
      "An Amoeba obtains food by endocytosis. It surrounds the food using pseudopodia and forms a food vacuole where digestion takes place."

  {
    question: "What is osmosis?",
    answer:
      "Osmosis is the movement of water through a semi-permeable membrane from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration."
  },

  {
    question: `Carry out the following osmosis experiment:
a) Keep potato cup A empty  
b) Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B  
c) Put one teaspoon salt in cup C  
d) Put one teaspoon sugar in boiled potato cup D`,
    answer: `
• Water collects in cups B and C due to osmosis because the solutions are more concentrated.  
• Cup A acts as a control showing no osmosis without concentration difference.  
• Water does not collect in cup D because boiling destroys the semi-permeable membrane.
