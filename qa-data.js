    question: "What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or breaks down?",
    answer: "If the plasma membrane ruptures, the contents of the cell will leak into the surrounding environment. This will disturb the internal balance of the cell, stopping essential life processes. As a result, the cell will eventually die."
  },

  {
    question: "What would happen to the life of a cell if there was no Golgi apparatus?",
    answer: "The Golgi apparatus modifies, packages, and transports proteins and lipids. Without it, these substances would not reach their correct destinations, disrupting secretion and transport. This would severely affect cell functioning and survival."
  },

  {
    question: "Which organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell? Why?",
    answer: "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because they produce energy in the form of ATP during cellular respiration. This energy is required for all activities of the cell."
  },

  {
    question: "Where do the lipids and proteins constituting the cell membrane get synthesised?",
    answer: "Lipids are synthesised in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, while proteins are synthesised by ribosomes, mainly on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These are later modified and transported by the Golgi apparatus."
  },

  {
    question: "How does an Amoeba obtain its food?",
    answer: "An Amoeba obtains its food by endocytosis. It forms finger-like projections called pseudopodia that surround the food particle and engulf it, forming a food vacuole where digestion occurs."
  },

  {
    question: "What is osmosis?",
    answer: "Osmosis is the movement of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration. It is a passive process."
  },

  {
    question: "Why does water gather in the hollowed portions of potato cups B and C?",
    answer: "Sugar and salt solutions inside cups B and C create a concentrated solution. Water moves from the surrounding dilute solution into the cups by osmosis, causing water to collect inside."
  },

  {
    question: "Why is potato cup A necessary for the osmosis experiment?",
    answer: "Potato cup A acts as a control. It shows that osmosis occurs only when there is a concentration difference between the inside and outside of the potato tissue."
  },

  {
    question: "Why does water not gather in the hollowed portions of potato cups A and D?",
    answer: "In cup A, no solute is present, so no osmotic movement occurs. In cup D, boiling destroys the semi-permeable membrane of potato cells, preventing osmosis."
