Task: Diagnose Cloudflare Pages build failure

Work Log:
- Analyzed Cloudflare Pages build log showing two errors:
  1. npm ERESOLVE: @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1.13.16 peer dep requires Next.js <=15.5.2, but project uses Next.js 16.2.6
  2. wrangler.toml missing pages_build_output_dir property
- Searched for compatible Cloudflare adapters
- Found @opennextjs/cloudflare@1.19.11 which supports Next.js >=16.2.6

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: @cloudflare/next-on-pages does NOT support Next.js 16
- Solution: Migrate to @opennextjs/cloudflare (Cloudflare's officially maintained adapter)

Task: Fix dual typing indicators, add real-time notification feature, add new stickers with animations

Task: Replies V2 + GIF picker fix (version 60.0.0)

Work Log:
- **Task 1A: GIF picker CSS** — Replaced old masonry `column-count:2` layout (lines 2070-2134) with clean grid layout (`grid-template-columns:repeat(2,1fr)`), fixed positioning (`right:0` instead of `left:8px;right:8px`), added `.bqgifp-nav` pagination CSS, `.bqgifp-prev`/`.bqgifp-next` buttons, `.bqgifp-page` indicator, `.bqgifp-item.bqgifp-err` error state, and `.bqgifp-skel` with aspect-ratio:1 pulse animation
- **Task 1B: attachGifPicker function** — Replaced old infinite-scroll `appendGifs`/`loadMore` pattern with pagination version: `PER_PAGE=6`, `_allData` array, `renderPage()`, `fetchMore()`, prev/next button navigation, `updateNav()` with page counter
- **Task 1C: Giphy API limit** — Changed `const limit = 24` → `6` at line 4188 and `const limit=24` → `6` at line 7454
- **Task 2A: Reply Preview CSS** — Replaced old `.bqrp`/`.bqrp-n`/`.bqrp-t` styles (border-left:3px solid, dated look) with modern design: `border-radius:8px`, `border-left:2px solid`, `background:rgba(96,165,250,.1)`, uppercase name, smaller text
- **Task 2B: Reply Bar CSS** — Replaced old `.bqrbar` styles (backdrop-filter blur, border on close button) with sleek design: no backdrop-filter, borderless close button, accent-tinted background, hover red close
- **Task 2C: Reply Bar HTML** — Updated both global (`bqgrbar`) and DM (`bqdmrbar`) reply bars: replaced old `<line>` X icons with path-based `<path d="M18 6 6 18"/><path d="m6 6 12 12"/>`
- **Task 2D: v43 patch** — Added at end of file to override stale `.bqrp`/`.bqrbar` styles from v35 and earlier patches (using !important), icon patching (replaces old `<line>` X with path-based), and GIF label theming
- **Task 2E: Version bump** — Changed `WIDGET_VERSION` from `'2.0.0'` to `'60.0.0'` and updated `chat-widget-version.json` from `49.0.0` to `60.0.0`
- **Syntax check** — `node -c chat-widget.js` passed with no errors

Stage Summary:
- GIF picker no longer uses masonry column-count layout (was causing overlapping)
- GIF picker now has proper pagination with prev/next buttons and page counter
- GIF API calls fetch 6 at a time instead of 24 (matches pagination)
- Reply preview inside messages uses modern rounded style instead of dated left-border-only
- Reply bar has clean borderless close button with red hover state
- v43 patch ensures earlier patches' stale CSS is overridden
- Widget version bumped to 60.0.0

Task: Replies V2 — Fix every visual and logic aspect of replies, modern sleek design, no duplicate UI elements. Fix GIF section navigation and overlapping. Fix chat lag/glitchiness.

Work Log:
- Analyzed the full 14K+ line chat-widget.js to identify 4 competing swipe-to-reply systems (v19, v20, v21, v24) causing severe lag
- Identified reply chip CSS defined 3 times with !important arms race (base, v3, v43)
- Found reply-to-reply only showing usernames because swipe handlers extracted text from .bqbbl.innerText which captured reply chip @username as first line
- Found edit handler losing reply chips due to wrong selectors (.bqreply, .bq-replyref instead of .bqrp)
- Found no click-to-scroll on reply chips
- Found GIF navigation too small/transparent
- Created comprehensive v44 patch (~570 lines) with 7 sections:
  1. CSS: Unified reply chip CSS, suppressed old swipe visuals, bigger GIF nav with labels, fixed GIF grid overlapping
  2. Unified capture-phase swipe handler replacing all 4 competing systems — uses stopImmediatePropagation() to block old handlers
  3. Debounced setReply to prevent duplicate triggers from residual handlers
  4. Click-to-scroll on reply chips with highlight animation
  5. MutationObserver-based reply preservation on message edit
  6. GIF nav labels (Prev/Next text added to buttons)
  7. Global MutationObserver for ongoing DOM maintenance
- Exported setReply/clearReply/getReply from main IIFE to window._bqSetReply etc.
- Fixed doAction reply handler to extract proper text with type info (🎬 GIF, 📷 Photo, 👾 Sticker, 🎤 Voice note)
- Fixed setReply to show nested reply context (↩ @user: original text → reply text)
- Fixed edit handler selector from .bqreply/.bq-replyref to .bqrp
- Added data-reply-key attribute to .bqrp elements for efficient click-to-scroll
- Bumped version to 61.0.0
- Pushed to GitHub

Stage Summary:
- v44 patch successfully loads (verified in browser console)
- All exported functions accessible (window._bqSetReply, _bqClearReply, _bqGetReply)
- GIF nav labels patched (2 prev + 2 next labels found)
- v44 CSS stylesheet applied
- No JS errors in console
- The 4 competing swipe systems are now suppressed via capture-phase interception + CSS visual hiding
