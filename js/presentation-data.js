<h1>Cell Wall</h1>

<p class="reveal-block">
The cell wall is a rigid, non-living outer covering present outside the plasma membrane
in plant cells, fungi, and many prokaryotes.
</p>

<p class="reveal-block">
It provides structural support and distinguishes plant cells from animal cells.

<h1>Chemical Composition</h1>

<p class="reveal-block">
The plant cell wall is mainly composed of <b>cellulose</b>, a polysaccharide made of
β-glucose units.

  <li class="reveal-block">Hemicellulose – provides flexibility</li>
  <li class="reveal-block">Pectin – helps in cell adhesion</li>
  <li class="reveal-block">Lignin – provides rigidity (secondary wall)</li>

title:"Structure of Cell Wall",
content:`
<h1>Structure</h1>

<p class="reveal-block">
The cell wall is composed of three layers: middle lamella, primary wall,
and secondary wall.
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="reveal-block"><b>Middle lamella:</b> Rich in pectin, cements adjacent cells</li>
  <li class="reveal-block"><b>Primary wall:</b> Thin, elastic, allows growth</li>
  <li class="reveal-block"><b>Secondary wall:</b> Thick, lignified, provides strength</li>
</ul>

title:"Functions",

<h1>Functions of Cell Wall</h1>

<ul>
  <li class="reveal-block">Maintains shape and rigidity of the cell</li>
  <li class="reveal-block">Prevents osmotic bursting in hypotonic solutions</li>
  <li class="reveal-block">Provides mechanical protection</li>
  <li class="reveal-block">Allows free diffusion of substances</li>
</ul>
`

{
title:"Importance",
content:`
<h1>Why Cell Wall is Important</h1>

<p class="reveal-block">
Without the cell wall, plant cells would lose rigidity and burst due to osmotic pressure.
</p>

<p class="reveal-block">
It is essential for plant growth, mechanical strength, and resistance to pathogens.
