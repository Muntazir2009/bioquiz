       SLIDE 1 – INTRODUCTION
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "What is a Cell Wall?",
      content: `
        The <b>cell wall</b> is a rigid, non-living outer layer found outside the plasma membrane.
        It is present in <b>plant cells</b>, <b>fungi</b>, <b>bacteria</b>, and some protists.
        <br><br>
        The cell wall gives the cell a definite shape, strength, and protection.
        It also prevents the cell from bursting due to excess water entry.
      `
    },

    /* ===============================
       SLIDE 2 – DISCOVERY
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "Discovery of the Cell Wall",
      content: `
        The cell wall was first observed by <b>Robert Hooke</b> in <b>1665</b> while studying cork.
        <br><br>
        Hooke noticed box-like compartments, which he called <b>cells</b>.
        These compartments were actually empty cell walls of dead plant tissue.
        <br><br>
        This discovery laid the foundation of modern cell biology.
      `
    },

    /* ===============================
       SLIDE 3 – FIRST OBSERVATION
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "First Observation of Cell Wall",
      content: `
        The cell wall was first seen in <b>plant cells</b> because it is thick and easily visible.
        <br><br>
        Early microscopes could not clearly show internal organelles,
        but the rigid outer boundary (cell wall) was easily observed.
        <br><br>
        Animal cells do not have a cell wall, which is why it was not observed in them.

    /* ===============================
       SLIDE 4 – COMPOSITION
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "Composition of Cell Wall",
      content: `
        In plant cells, the cell wall is mainly made of:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cellulose</b> – provides strength</li>
          <li><b>Hemicellulose</b> – binds cellulose fibers</li>
          <li><b>Pectin</b> – provides flexibility</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        In bacteria, the cell wall is made of <b>peptidoglycan</b>,
        while in fungi it is made of <b>chitin</b>.
      `

    /* ===============================
       SLIDE 5 – LAYERS
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "Layers of the Cell Wall",
      content: `
        The plant cell wall has <b>three main layers</b>:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Middle Lamella</b> – binds neighboring cells</li>
          <li><b>Primary Cell Wall</b> – thin, flexible layer</li>
          <li><b>Secondary Cell Wall</b> – thick, rigid layer</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        The secondary wall is found in mature cells like xylem.

       SLIDE 6 – FUNCTIONS
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "Functions of Cell Wall",
      content: `
        The cell wall performs several important functions:
        <ul>
          <li>Gives <b>shape</b> to the cell</li>
          <li>Provides <b>mechanical strength</b></li>
          <li>Protects against physical injury</li>
          <li>Prevents <b>osmotic bursting</b></li>
          <li>Allows diffusion of substances</li>
        </ul>
      `
    },

    /* ===============================
       SLIDE 7 – PERMEABILITY
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "Permeability of Cell Wall",
      content: `
        The cell wall is <b>freely permeable</b>.
        <br><br>
        This means it allows water, gases, and small molecules to pass through easily.
        <br><br>
        The plasma membrane inside the cell wall controls selective transport.
      `
    },

    /* ===============================
       SLIDE 8 – IMPORTANCE
    =============================== */
    {
      heading: "Why is the Cell Wall Important?",
      content: `
        Without a cell wall:
        <ul>
          <li>Plant cells would lose shape</li>
          <li>Cells could burst in hypotonic solutions</li>
          <li>Plants would not remain upright</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The cell wall is essential for plant structure and survival.
