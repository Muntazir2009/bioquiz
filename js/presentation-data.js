  <h2>Cell Wall</h2>
  <p class="blur">
    The cell wall is a rigid, non-living outer covering present outside the plasma membrane
    of plant cells, fungi, and bacteria.
  </p>

  <p class="blur">
    It provides shape, support, and protection to the cell and prevents it from bursting
    in hypotonic solutions.
  </p>

{
  title: "Occurrence",
  content: `
  <h2>Occurrence of Cell Wall</h2>

  <p class="blur">Present in plant cells, fungi, algae, and most prokaryotes.</p>

  <p class="blur">Absent in animal cells, which only have a plasma membrane.</p>

  title: "Chemical Composition",

  <h2>Chemical Composition</h2>

  <p class="blur">
    In plants, the cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin.
  </p>

  <p class="blur">
    In fungi, it is made of chitin, while in bacteria it is made of peptidoglycan.

  <h2>Layers of Cell Wall</h2>

  <p class="blur"><b>Middle Lamella:</b> Outermost layer rich in calcium pectate.</p>
  <p class="blur"><b>Primary Cell Wall:</b> Thin, elastic, allows growth.</p>
  <p class="blur"><b>Secondary Cell Wall:</b> Thick, rigid, deposited after growth.</p>

  title: "Functions",
  content: `
  <h2>Functions of Cell Wall</h2>

  <p class="blur">Gives definite shape and rigidity to the cell.</p>
  <p class="blur">Protects cell from mechanical injury.</p>
  <p class="blur">Prevents excessive water uptake and bursting.</p>
  <p class="blur">Allows exchange of materials through plasmodesmata.</p>

{
  title: "Plasmodesmata",
  content: `
  <h2>Plasmodesmata</h2>

  <p class="blur">
    Plasmodesmata are cytoplasmic connections between adjacent plant cells.
  </p>

  <p class="blur">
    They help in transport of materials and communication between cells.
  </p>

{
  title: "Exam Focus",
  content: `
  <h2>Exam-Oriented Points</h2>

  <p class="blur">Cell wall is fully permeable.</p>
  <p class="blur">It is non-living in nature.</p>
  <p class="blur">Provides turgidity to plant cells.</p>

  title: "Quick Check",
  content: `
  <h2>Think & Reveal</h2>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>Q:</b> Why do plant cells not burst in hypotonic solution?</p>
    <p class="blur"><b>Ans:</b> Because the rigid cell wall resists excessive water entry.</p>
  </div>

{
  title: "Summary",
  content: `
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p class="blur">
    The cell wall is an essential protective layer in plant cells that maintains shape,
    provides strength, and ensures survival in varying environments.
