        <div class="reveal-block">
          The <b>cell wall</b> is a rigid, non-living outer layer present outside
          the plasma membrane of plant cells. It provides a definite shape,
          protection, and mechanical strength to the cell.
          <br><br>
          The cell wall also prevents the cell from bursting when excess water
          enters the cell due to osmosis.

       SLIDE 2 – COMPOSITION
    =============================== */

        <div class="reveal-block">
          The plant cell wall is mainly composed of:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cellulose</b> – provides tensile strength</li>
            <li><b>Hemicellulose</b> – binds cellulose fibres together</li>
            <li><b>Pectin</b> – provides flexibility and porosity</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          In addition, some cells contain <b>lignin</b>, which increases rigidity,
          especially in xylem cells.
        </div>

       SLIDE 3 – LAYERS

      heading: "Layers of the Cell Wall",
      content: `
        <div class="reveal-block">
          The plant cell wall consists of three main layers:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Middle Lamella</b> – cements adjacent cells together</li>
            <li><b>Primary Cell Wall</b> – thin, elastic, and allows growth</li>
            <li><b>Secondary Cell Wall</b> – thick, rigid, and fully developed</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          The secondary wall is commonly found in mature cells and provides
          maximum strength.

    {
      heading: "Functions of the Cell Wall",
      content: `
        <div class="reveal-block">
          The cell wall performs several vital functions:
          <ul>
            <li>Gives a definite shape to the cell</li>
            <li>Provides mechanical support and rigidity</li>
            <li>Protects the cell from physical damage</li>
            <li>Prevents osmotic bursting in hypotonic solutions</li>
            <li>Allows free movement of water and gases</li>
          </ul>
