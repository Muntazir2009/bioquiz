    title: "Eukaryotic Cell",
    content:
      "Eukaryotic cells contain a true nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane. They possess membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes, which allow compartmentalization of cellular functions."
  },
  {
    title: "Prokaryotic Cell",
    content:
      "Prokaryotic cells lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Genetic material is present in a nucleoid region. Examples include bacteria and cyanobacteria."

  {
    title: "Plasma Membrane",
    content:
      "The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. It regulates movement of substances into and out of the cell."

  {
    title: "Mitochondria",
    content:
      "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. They generate ATP through cellular respiration and contain their own DNA and ribosomes."

    title: "Why Cells Are Specialized",
    content:
      "Cells differentiate to perform specific functions efficiently. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to survive, grow, and adapt to their environment."
